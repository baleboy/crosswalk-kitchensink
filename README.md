## A showcase of Crosswalk features

This show case is based on Polymer and web components and many things works in Chrome, though a few things will only work in Crosswalk.

### Get started

First install Bower. Instructions can be found at http://bower.io

Then run

$ bower install

In order to test you need to run a web server. Using python that is quite easy

$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080

Then open http://localhost:8080 in your web browser. Look up the machine's IP address and replace localhost with that if you want to run it on a mobile device connected to the same network.
